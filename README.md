Introduction 

For this assignment we were required to develop a well and functional Tamagotchi app for Android, which allows the user to play, clean, and feed the virtual pet. The game also shows the points or the status of the pet. This app is called Fluffy’s Petopia.  

Design of the App 

The app design process consists of a series of stages and iterations. It started with a step-by-step plan where we had to plan what information will be in the app, what the app will look like and the code of the app. The Tamagotchi app or virtual pet game was called ‘Fluffy’s Petopia.’ The Tamagotchi app designs start with an idea and end with its application in store. The first thing I considered when designing the Tamagotchi app was that I had to be clear about the functionality the app seeks to address and how users will use it. I had to aloow users to care for the virtual pet on their smartphones or digital devices, mimicking the Tamagotchi toy’s experience. The following is what was used: 

 

Pet: Bunny

Second Screen: The points or status will be shown here including the feed, play, and clean buttons.

Bathing: This image shows the bunny bathing which is known as clean in the virtual pet game.

Feeding: This image or picture shows the bunny eating which will be “feed” in the virtual pet game.

Playing: Same as the previous picture or image, the bunny is playing which is “Play” in the virtual pet game.

We planned the app in 4 steps: the conceptualization, the definition, the design, and the development. 

 

Conceptualization is when the designer gathers information from the users about what the app should be about, the needs and the functions of the app, and it is when the designer creates the ideation and the planning of the design.  

 

Definition is when the designer defines in detail and writing who will be the user and what will be the app’s functionality. It helps plan the project properly, it helps the designer know the requirements needed and the duration of the development. 

 

Design is the most important because it is time-consuming and needs a lot of work. The design is split into substages which are; the wireframes, the prototypes, the tests, and the visual design.  

 

Development is when we work on the programming application code and the correction of functional and design bugs that arise after testing the app. The developer then creates the structure on which the app will awork and ensures that the app is functioning successfully.  

 

The designer must design the user experience (UX) is the phase in which the developer is the user testing for any bugs or problems in the app and/or code. This phase defines the app’s processes and content structure. User experiences (UX) are created using wireframes and prototypes which form the basis of the developer’s work.  

The designer must then design the user interface (UI0 which is worked on once the structure, the content, and the functionalities of the app are advanced and working. In this stage the user knows how to use the app without having to think too much or have any problems regarding the app.  

The designer works on the user interface kit (UI-kit). In the user interface kit (UI-kit) they define the following; 

Generic elements 

Color spaces 

General graphic designs 

Typographies 

The designer then moves to the catalog of graphic elements (UI-kit), which include: 

The buttons 

The image sizes 

The lay out 

The content modules 

The visual resources    

The fonts 

The animations 

Once the prototype of the app structure is done and validated, the designer applies the graphic elements (UI-kit) guidelines on the screen which show the designer what the app will look like. They will then also add images, animations, and interactions.  

The goal is to make the user interface simple and easy to use because user satisfaction depends on it. The user should be taken into account throughout the entire design process of the app for user satisfaction to be achieved. 

 The Picture above shows an empty screen with no designs or structure. The screen will be where we design the app and add all the user experience and user interface. The purpose of the above picture is aimed at presenting the app to the user, its features, and how useful it may be. The screen will be where we design the app and add all the user experience and user interface. The screen will be where we design the app and add all the user experience and user interface. The onboarding app screen has to explain to the user the benefits of the app. 

 The above picture shows the design of the app and what it looks like. 
 The above picture shows a closer look of the previous picture. This image shows the user the welcoming screen to the game and gives them an instruction on where to click to start the game.
 The above picture shows the design of the game after the welcome screen and what the user should expect when they click the “Start” button on the first screen.   

 The above picture shows a close up of the previous picture. In this picture the user clicks the “Feed” button, and it will show the bunny feeding. They will then click the “Play” button and it will show the bunny playing, and they will click “Clean” button and it will show the bunny bathing. As they click the buttons the points or the status of the pet will update. 

 

GitHub  

In the GitHub app we are creating a repository so we can push our work into GitHub and be able to submit. After creating a repository, you create a branch which helps the designer have different versions of a repository at one time. Make the changes you want to make to the document and commit or push the changes and save the changes to the files in your repository. After committing to the changes in a branch of main, the designer can open a pull request. After committing to the changes, you will merge your read-me-edits branch into the main branch. After the designer merges the commits, the changes on your read-edits branch will be incorporated into main. 
THANK YOU!!
